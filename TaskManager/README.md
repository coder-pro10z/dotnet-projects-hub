## ✅ **Why This Repository?**

Because the best way to learn .NET is by **building real applications**, following a **structured roadmap**:

* **Set 1** → Core C# Fundamentals
* **Set 2** → Production-Ready Design Patterns
* **Set 3** → Advanced Cloud-Native Architecture

🔥 Do you want me to **also create a `README.md` template for each individual project** (with sections like *Overview, Features, Setup, How It Works, Screenshots*) so that each project has its own professional documentation?
Or should I **give you the final copy-paste-ready README for TaskManager now**?
